# 🌌 Tatooine Inter·im - 24h Challenge Project

This project was created during a **24-hour team challenge** at the Wild Code School.  
Working in a team of six, we built a fictional recruitment agency set in the Star Wars universe: **Tatooine Interim** - matching clients with unconventional job opportunities… even if some of the clients are already dead.

## About the Project

The goal was to build a fun, fully responsive website in only **24 hours**.  
The site includes:

- A hero section introducing the agency  
- A grid of services and job offers  
- A testimonials section featuring "clients" from the Star Wars universe  
- A playful design system referencing sci-fi themes  

Everything was created collaboratively during this short hackathon.
